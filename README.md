This application allows users to search clips from Twitch's API. Users are able to search for clips based on their favorite game or streamer. 

Once given a list of the top clips from their search, the user will be able to watch the clips and save their favorites into the database. Then the saved clips will be displayed onto a seperate "favorite clips page" for easy viewing.
